Billings
========

The big advantage to have all records of your activities on a numerical platform means that the extremely boring work to edit bills on your project
can be done in a few clicks. The process is in three steps:

* Bill creation
* Bill check: validation (go to next row) or deleting (do it again from start)
* Bill is send to finance for processing at the delegation

    Billings: Three steps, creation and processing (2 steps within) (so 1+2=3 yes!!)

Billing creation
****************

First, the PI creates a bill for his project using WU records of any WUs registered on its project. For
this, click on *Create Bill* (see :numref:`billing_choice` and :numref:`billing_creation`). Use the filters to select records
of a given *billing entity* (as defined on the *Co√ªts Complet* file), within a given date range and registered on your project.
When all filters are green, the button *Create an extraction* appears. By clicking on it, you create an extraction of
records that will be used for your bill. At that point you will be redirected on
the *Bill processing* page (you could later on click on the *Process Bills* link (see :numref:`billing_choice`) to
get there again). Please read below.

    Bill creation: Pick a *billing entity*, a *date range*, a *project*. Click *Create extraction*. First step done


Billing processing
******************

On this webpage (see :numref:`billing_processing`), as a PI you will be able to download the bill relative of a given
extraction as a *.xlsx* file. Check it!

* If the bill is incorrect (what is incorrect? Well ask Muriel I would say... :-) ), press the *Delete* button and do it again.
* If the bill is correct (what is correct? Well ask Alain otherwise Muriel will probably kill you), you can click *Send Bill*. This will
  send an email to the financial service so that the bill can be processed and sent to the delegation.
  **No more modification can be done after your click this button!!!**

When an extraction is done, the related WUs are no more selectable for an extraction until it is eventually deleted.
When the bill has been sent, the bill amount will be subtracted from your project amount visible on the `Project`_ page.

    Bill processing: Select a bill (a record *extraction*). Then check it after downloading. It is fine? Press *Send Bill*!
    It is Wrong? Press *Delete* and do it again but correctly this time, I'm sure you can do it ;-)
