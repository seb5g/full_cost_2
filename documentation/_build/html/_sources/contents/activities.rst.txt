Activities
==========

This link will get you to the dedicated web page. We classified (without any second thought, I swear :-) ) the lab activities as follow:

* :ref:`ref_act_chemistry`: for all experiments of the Chemistry Service
* :ref:`ref_act_opt_serv`: for all experiments of the Optical Service
* :ref:`ref_act_imag`: for all AFM and near-field machines (AFM/STM...) (but the TERS)
* :ref:`ref_act_engi`: Mechanics and electronics are grouped within this activity
* :ref:`ref_act_tem`: for all electronic microscopes (but the PS2I MEB)
* :ref:`ref_act_fib`: for the Helios and Zeiss FIB
* :ref:`ref_act_ps2i`: for all experiments of the PS2I service
* :ref:`ref_act_prepa`: for all apparatus/tools of the preparation service but the FIBs
* :ref:`ref_act_nanofab`: for all apparatus related to fabrication: Growth, implantation, clean room tools and apparatus.

For all of these, you can do three things (see :numref:`navbar_activity`):

* Add New *Working Units* (default activity web page, see specific links above)
* See a *Working Units* exhaustive summary (see for instance :numref:`records`)
* *Export* this summary as an excel file (try it!)

   Within an activity: three possible choices: add a new WU, see a list of registered units and export the full list as a *.xlsx* file


Each activity, or even subactivities have a specific WU and way to register them. Please refer to each activity webpage for a description.

   Example of a list of records for the Optical Platform. Various filters can be used and the table can be sorted using any column
