Optical Spectroscopy Platform
=============================

In the *Optical platform* the Working Unit is **half a day**.

In case, you made a mistake registering your WUs, contact the
head of the specific activity, (here `Sébastien Weber`_) as he will be able to modify it. He will be able do to so only before the 5th
of the month following your run.

The *New Working Units* form for the Optical Spectroscopy Platform is shown on :numref:`fig_optics`. All fields
are mandatory and briefly explained below:

   Form to enter new Working Units


* *date* and *time* fields:  (see :numref:`fig_period`) specify a time interval from which the number of working
  units will be automatically calculated. The calculation excludes weekend days from the period.
* *Experiment*: this field lists all possible experiments within the platform. There are 3 particular cases related with
  the use of the chemistry spectrometers from room A125. For these, you have to enter manually the number of WUs you did
  in the given period. They can be set by step of 0.5.
* *Nnights*: number of nights during the time interval where a given experiment was running late (after 12PM). This adds
  one WU per late night.
* *WU*: number of working units during the interval
* *Project and PI*: select the project on which these WUs should be counted. If there is not a given funding project
  to use, then select the one called *Divers/Other Name* or *Service/Other Name* in maintenance case.
* *User*: the person doing the experiment. Automatically selected if the user is logged
* *Group*: its group, select it within the list. Automatically selected if the user is logged
* *Remark*: Some details on the ongoing experiment.
