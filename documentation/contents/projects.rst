Projects
========

This link on the website header opens a web page displaying, as a table (see :numref:`fig_projects`), the list of all
funding projects in the lab together with
their “Principal Investigators, the PIs! The “Amount Left” column is giving you an approximate value of the total amount
of money eligible on your projects for internal billing.

   A short extract of the *Projects* web-page


The others columns are meant to characterize the type of price that should be applied to the Working Units you will bill
on your project.

* *Is Academic* tells you if your project is private or not. For all researchers with
  grants in the lab, this parameter is ``True``. It is False only for private companies or when a * technical service* (optics,
  prepa, ...) make an experiment or a sample for some external people. For  instance a sample preparation for an industry
  that doesn't have any project with a CEMES's researcher.
* *Is national* tells you (valid only for an *Academic project*) if it is from a national agency (ANR, NEXT…) or an international
  one (Europe,...) but also private **partners** such as in the case of a CIFRE funding).
* *Is CNRS* tells if the project is managed by the CNRS (``True``), while
  if it is managed by Insa or a University or some other institution it will be set to ``False``.

If you have a new project that is not in the list: Please contact `Christine Viala`_  , that will be delighted to add
it to the database. You should tell her:

* the project name
* the project PI
* if it is (or not) Academic, National and CNRS
* The amount of available money for *Internal Billing* for the current year
* Its date validity (end of the project)

**NB:**
In the case of a private company or someone external to the lab or its partners asking for an experiment or a sample,
the lab *technical service* that has been sought should ask Christine to add a project name to this company or this
*someone*. In that case, the working units done for this company could also be put automatically inside a bill ready
to be send (see :ref:`billings`)
