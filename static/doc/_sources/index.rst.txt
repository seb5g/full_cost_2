Welcome to Full Cost's documentation!
=====================================

This is the complete documentation on how to use correctly the full cost platform and answer some (all?) of your
questions! But first what is it?

This website lets you record working units within all experimental activities at CEMES that have been registered in the
*Coûts complets* (Full-cost) project. These units are registered as related to a given funding project. At some point in the year,
the principal investigator of the project decide to use the registered units on its project to create a bill. The amount of this bill
will be sent to the CNRS delegation in the form of an order automatically generated by the platform.
